Current big data benchmarks (e.g., HiBench) aim to test the performance of big data frameworks (e.g., Hadoop MapReduce).
However, there is not a suite to test whether the deployed frameworks can tolerate static and runtime faults, including
data fault, configuration fault, program fault, hardware fault, etc.

This project aims to build a benchmarking suite to test the fault-tolerance capacity of big data frameworks (Hadoop and
Spark). We expect to use it to find bugs in current frameworks and also use it to detect the configuration/data/program
faults in the running applications.
